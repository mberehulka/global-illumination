# ray-traced-shadows
Ray traced shadows algorithm in Rust

Work in progress...

Study case of calculating shadows by testing collisions between the ray starting from texture pixel to the light, passing through vertices in the scene.

It's single-threaded and runs in the CPU, for simplicity's sake.

Keys: A, D, Q, E for rotation and W, S, R, F for translation
